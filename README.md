# ðŸš€ LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge

> **Goal:** Complete, clean, and efficient solutions for the official LeetCode "30 Days of JavaScript" challenge. This project is a focused effort to **reinforce fundamental JS knowledge**, sharpen **algorithmic thinking**, and prepare for **technical interviews**.

---

### **ðŸ’¡ Why This Challenge?**

This 30-day commitment ensures a deep dive into crucial JavaScript concepts and common algorithmic patterns often encountered in technical screens. Solutions are designed to be **idiomatic, clean, and highly efficient**.

### **ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview**

| Metric | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Problems** | 30 | A full month of dedicated practice. |
| **Language** | **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Utilizing modern JS features (e.g., arrow functions, `const`/`let`). |
| **Commitment** | **Daily Solution** | Tracking progress via daily commits within the `solutions` folder. |

---

### **ðŸ§  Key Concepts Reinforced**

The problems are selected to specifically strengthen core JavaScript and algorithmic pillars, ensuring comprehensive interview preparation:

* **Asynchronous JS:** Promises, `async`/`await`, and event loop understanding.
* **Data Structures:** Implementing and manipulating Arrays, Maps, Sets, Stacks, and Queues.
* **Closures & Scope:** Mastering function factories and variable accessibility.
* **Array Methods:** Practical application of `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and others for declarative coding.
* **Pointers & Sliding Window:** Optimizing algorithms for time efficiency.

---

### **ðŸ“‚ Solution Structure & Navigation**

All solutions reside in the `./solutions` folder. Each file is named sequentially (e.g., `Day01.js`, `Day02.js`) and adheres to a consistent, readable format:

```javascript
/**
 * Day XX: [Problem Name]
 * LeetCode Link: [Full Link to LeetCode Problem]
 *
 * @param {Type} input - Description of the input parameter.
 * @return {Type} - Description of the value returned by the function.
 */
var functionName = function(input) {
